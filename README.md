### FinRL Transformer Models ###

### Description ### 
The objective is to conduct an empirical study into the training and performance of transformer models under different loss functions. We leverage Yahoo Finance, Pytorch, and various machine learning modules.

### Goals ###
* Assess the effectiveness of employing Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error as loss functions in transformer models.
* Evaluate the impact of Cross-Entropy Loss on transformers, for time series predictions.
* Contrast and compare results processed from Long Short-Term Memory and Transformers.
* Establish a robust baseline model as a basis for FinRLâ€™s reinforcement models.
